            //Input → 10, 5
            //Output → Sum = 15, Difference = 5
            //Write a program to multiply and divide two numbers entered by the user.Use *, /, and /= operators to show how assignment works.

            //Input → 20, 4

            //Output → Product = 80, Quotient = 5
            //Write a C# program that takes an integer and prints its square and cube.Use * operator and compound assignment like num *= num;.

            //Input → 20, 4
            //Output → Product = 80, Quotient = 5
            //Write a C# program to input marks of 5 subjects.Use += operator to calculate total, then find percentage.
            //Example:
            //Input → 78, 85, 69, 90, 88
            //Output → Total = 410, Percentage = 82 %
